# Subproject 6 - Multi-Modal Vector-PRF (Rocchio)

## Overview
Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) aims to reduce the effect of query-passage vocabulary mismatch and thus improve search effectiveness by modifying the original query using information from top-ranked passages. PRF has been widely investigated in the context of traditional bag-of-words retrieval models. The use of the PRF process in the context of dense retrievers has seen some initial work.
This project will focus in particular on the Vector-PRF method for dense retrievers, which utilises the embeddings produced by dense retrievers, then fuses the top-k result vectors for each query from the initial retrieval results with the query vectors to form a new query vector. This approach has shown improvements on several tetx-based datasets with a high efficiency. This project will investigate this method on multimodal datasets, and in particular on datasets that contain images and are queried with text -- both represented as dense vectors.


## Core Tasks

- obtain code and FAISS index for Vector PRF on TREC DL; reproduce results, make sure it works
- obtain code and resources for CLIP, reproduce results, make sure it works
- bundle CLIP with Vector PRF; run it evaluate it, analyse results â€” how do parameters influence performance?
- [extension] could try more datasets or models, such as [X-VLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08276v2.pdf)
