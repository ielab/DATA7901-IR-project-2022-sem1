# Subproject 1 - DRs have problems with Entities

## Overview



Core Tasks

- obtain code and FAISS index, re-run their pipelines, evaluate the results accuracy to form the original table
- for a subset of queries, analyse the retrieved passages to identify: (1) are these relevant? (2) do they really mention/not-mention the entity?	
- [extension] extend the original experiments to DRs other than DPR: this requires understand how the DPR index of Wikidata was created, and process this data with other DRs.
